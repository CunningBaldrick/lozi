To build, you will need C and Ada compilers, as well as the arpack library.
On Linux ubuntu you can install these as follows:

  sudo apt install build-essential # C compiler plus some standard tools
  sudo apt install gnat gprbuild # Ada compiler and build tool
  sudo apt install libarpack2-dev # Arpack library

You should then be able to build the "calculate_entropy" program by running
  gprbuild
in this directory.

If you run the program without any command line arguments then it explains:
  Usage: ./calculate_entropy [-v] A_Numerator A_Denominator B_Numerator B_Denominator [desired accuracy]

For example:
  ./calculate_entropy -v 2 1 1 10 0.001
Here A_Numerator = 2, A_Denominator = 1, thus A is the fraction 2/1, otherwise
known as 2.  Likewise B_Numerator = 1, B_Denominator = 10, thus B is 1/10, aka
0.1.  The desired accuracy is 0.001.  Thanks to the -v (verbose) flag, you get
a lot of output, finishing up with
  Entropy (natural logarithm): 0.67748 <= Entropy <= 0.67845
The entropy of the Lozi map wih parameter a=2, b=0.1 is guaranteed to lie in
this range.
